title: Rule 8 — Requirements Fidelity
description: The spec is not an axiom. Requirements are verified (quality), validated (sense-check), and traced (need -> AC -> test -> proof) so a need cannot drop silently between intake and spec.

# Rule 8 — Requirements Fidelity

## The rule

**The spec is not an axiom.** Before a slice enters implementation, its requirements must be:

1. **Verified** — each acceptance criterion is singular, unambiguous, complete, consistent, feasible, and verifiable (the ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018 quality characteristics). A fresh-context gate checks this.
2. **Validated** — the requirement makes sense and serves the need. A human-owned scenario sense-check (positive AND negative) confirms the spec answers the right question, not just a well-formed one.
3. **Traced** — every need in the intake links to at least one acceptance criterion, every acceptance criterion links back to a need and forward to at least one test, and every slice links up a vertical golden thread (org objective → release benefit → slice, or the lightweight floor: slice → release goal).

A need that drops silently between intake and spec is a requirements-fidelity defect. The traceability matrix makes it visible and blocks the release.

## Why

Rules 1, 6, and 7 verify **delivery against the spec** rigorously. They treat the spec itself as an axiom — the spec is the contract, and the verifier checks the code against it. But the spec can be wrong, incomplete, or disconnected from what the user actually asked for. The front half of the fidelity chain — from intake need to spec acceptance criterion — is unverified by the delivery rules. A perfectly implemented, perfectly verified slice that answers the wrong question is a fidelity defect no amount of delivery rigour will catch.

The gap is structural: the delivery rules are **downstream** of the spec. They cannot see upstream. Rule 8 closes the front half.

This is the same insight the README frames around requirements failure: decades of post-mortems converge on *poor requirements* — lost, drifted, met-technically-but-missed-the-intent — as the dominant cause of project failure. Rules 1–7 keep delivery honest; Rule 8 keeps the requirement itself honest before delivery begins.

## The 2-D requirements traceability matrix (RTM)

The RTM is the enforcement mechanism. It has two axes and threads through the existing artefacts — no separate datastore.

### Horizontal: need → acceptance criterion → test → proof

```
intake.md          spec.md               spec.md             proof.md
--------           --------               --------            --------
N-01: need  --->   - [ ] AC cites N-01    Required tests  ->  test results
                   - [ ] AC cites N-01                        reachability
```

- **Needs** are enumerated with stable ids (`N-01`, `N-02`, …) in `intake.md`. The planner assigns ids at planning time; they are never reused.
- **Acceptance criteria** in each `spec.md` cite the need id(s) they satisfy, inline in the AC text (e.g. "WHEN … THE SYSTEM SHALL … (N-01)").
- **Required tests** in `spec.md` cite the acceptance check they exercise.
- **Proof** in `proof.md` closes `AC → test → proof` (already required by Rule 6).

The RTM adds the front half: `need → AC`. An orphaned need (no linked AC) or an orphaned AC (cites no need, or cites a need but has no test) is a broken trace.

### Vertical: org objective → release benefit → slice

```
org objective  --->  release benefit  --->  slice
(optional)           (index.md)             (status.json)
```

- **Org objective** is opt-in. A solo founder or small team may have no declared objective — the vertical floor is `slice → release goal`.
- **Release benefit** is the value the release delivers, recorded in `index.md`.
- **Slice link** is the slice's contribution to the release benefit, recorded in `status.json`.

The vertical trace is the golden thread: line-of-sight from strategy (if declared) through release value to individual slices. For solo/small teams the floor is lightweight: `slice → release goal` satisfies the vertical trace without an org-objective link.

## Enforcement

A deterministic, fail-closed traceability gate builds the matrix from `intake.md` / `spec.md` / `status.json` / `index.md` alone — no separate datastore. It exits non-zero on:

- An orphaned need (need with no linked acceptance criterion).
- An orphaned acceptance criterion (cites no need id, or cites a need but has no linked test).
- A slice with no vertical link (no release goal in intake and no release benefit or org objective on the slice).

A fully-traced release prints the matrix and exits 0. The source reference implementation is a `lint trace`-style command; adopters port the check to their own tooling, the same way Rule 7's `sworn verify` is ported.

## EARS notation — structured acceptance criteria

The RTM enforces *traceability* (need → AC → test). EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) enforces *structure* — each acceptance criterion is a single sentence with a fixed keyword shape, not free-form prose. Together they form the front-end fidelity gate: traced AND well-formed.

A deterministic gate classifies every acceptance check in every slice's `spec.md` by EARS pattern and fails closed on any free-form check that matches no pattern, naming the slice and the offending line.

| Class | Pattern | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Ubiquitous | `THE SYSTEM SHALL <action>` | `THE SYSTEM SHALL display the dashboard.` |
| Event-driven | `WHEN <trigger> THE SYSTEM SHALL <action>` | `WHEN a user clicks save THE SYSTEM SHALL persist the form.` |
| State-driven | `WHILE <state> THE SYSTEM SHALL <action>` | `WHILE in maintenance mode THE SYSTEM SHALL show a banner.` |
| Optional-feature | `WHERE <feature> THE SYSTEM SHALL <action>` | `WHERE a premium feature is enabled THE SYSTEM SHALL show the export button.` |
| Unwanted-behaviour | `IF <condition> THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL <action>` | `IF the database is unreachable THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL return a 503 error.` |
| Complex | Two or more preconditions combined | `WHEN a user clicks save WHILE the form is valid THE SYSTEM SHALL persist the form.` |

**The `NOTE:` escape.** A line prefixed with `NOTE:` is a deliberate non-requirement note and is excluded from validation — use it for context that is not a testable requirement (a design constraint, a cross-reference, a rationale). Without the escape such lines would fail the gate as free-form.

**Why EARS, not Gherkin.** Gherkin (Given-When-Then) was considered and rejected: EARS is lighter (one sentence per requirement, no scenario tables), is the de-facto notation for agent-authored requirements, and maps cleanly to the checkbox format already used in `spec.md`. The decision is recorded; adopters need not re-litigate it.

## Spec-quality metric — pre-code soundness + completeness

Before a spec reaches verification or validation, a deterministic, pre-code first-pass computes soundness + completeness from a slice's **acceptance examples** alone — no source code, no model call.

Every spec SHOULD carry a `## Acceptance examples` section with one or more **input → expected-output** pairs per acceptance check:

```
## Acceptance examples

- name: "valid-ears-pass"
  input: "a release where every AC matches an EARS pattern"
  expected: "the AC lint exits 0 and prints the per-pattern distribution"
- name: "free-form-fail"
  input: "a release with at least one free-form AC"
  expected: "the AC lint exits 1 naming the slice and line"
```

- **Soundness** — for each example, the expected output must be consistent with the acceptance criteria (the criteria must not reject a valid output). A limited deterministic check that flags contradictions like "expects failure where criteria describe only a pass case."
- **Completeness (mutation analysis)** — deterministic mutation operators are applied to the expected output (flip exit codes, negate assertions, remove keywords) and the gate checks what fraction the criteria would reject. The score is `caught / total`; below the threshold (default 50%) the gate fails closed.

Because it is the cheapest check (deterministic, no model, no human), spec-quality runs first. A spec with no acceptance examples or low completeness never reaches model-based verification.

## Validation — human-owned sense-check

Validation answers "are we building the *right* requirements?" — does the spec make sense and serve the need (distinct from verification's "are the requirements well-formed?"). This is the cheapest defect-catch point and is **human-owned**: the model drafts scenarios + a benefit hypothesis; the human ratifies. Spec validation has no oracle but the user, so this gate is never model self-certified.

Every slice carries a validation record in its `status.json`:

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `human_ratified` | Yes | Must be `true`. Model-only validation is not a pass. |
| `ratified_by` | Yes | Who ratified (human identifier). |
| `ratified_at` | Yes | When ratified (ISO 8601). |
| `positive_scenarios` | Yes (≥1) | Scenarios where the requirement works as intended. |
| `negative_scenarios` | Yes (≥1) | Edge + failure flows; what should *not* happen. |
| `benefit_hypothesis` | Yes | This slice's benefit and its vertical link (slice → release benefit → objective). |

A deterministic gate fails closed on a missing record, model-only ratification, empty positive or negative scenarios, or a blank benefit hypothesis.

## Definition of Ready

The Definition of Ready (DoR) is the gate every slice passes before it can transition from `planned` to `in_progress`. It composes the three checks into a single fail-closed verdict:

1. **Traced** — the RTM verifies complete traceability (horizontal + vertical).
2. **Verified** — every acceptance criterion passes the 29148 quality-characteristic check via a fresh-context model pass.
3. **Validated** — the slice carries a human-ratified validation record.

If any gate fails, the transition is blocked and the failing gate(s) named. If any gate cannot be evaluated (missing artefact, no verifier model configured), the transition is also blocked — fail closed. There is no bypass: an explicit human re-plan is the only way to change a spec, never a silent skip.

## Relationship to existing rules

| Rule | What it does | How Rule 8 complements it |
|---|---|---|
| Rule 1 — Reachability Gate | Tests exercise the integration point | Rule 8 ensures the integration point is the *right* one — traced to a need |
| Rule 2 — No Silent Deferrals | Surfaces drift explicitly | Rule 8 makes a dropped need a hard, detectable trace break |
| Rule 6 — Proof Bundle | Closes AC → test → proof | Rule 8 adds the front half: need → AC. Together they form the full horizontal chain |
| Rule 7 — Adversarial Verification | Fresh-context verification of delivery | Rule 8 verifies the spec itself, before delivery verification runs |

## When this rule applies

- Any release with an `intake.md` that declares needs. The RTM is the enforcement; the planner constructs the trace as a by-product of planning.
- The `planned → in_progress` transition (Definition of Ready) gates on the RTM, verification, and validation all passing.

## When this rule does NOT apply

- Spikes or exploratory work without a release intake.
- A release with no declared needs (the RTM reports an empty matrix and exits 0 — no needs means no traces to break).

## Provenance

Rule 8 was introduced in the `2026-06-16-fidelity-layer` cycle. It closes the "front half" fidelity gap surfaced during the v0.5.0 cycle: the delivery rules (1/6/7) verify code against spec, but nothing verified the spec against the need. The RTM is the keystone — it threads through existing artefacts and enforces traceability fail-closed, so a need cannot drop silently between intake and spec.
