# Journal: S05-requirements-validate-gate

## Session log

### 2026-06-18 16:00 — session start / state transition

- **State**: `planned → in_progress → implemented`
- **Notes**:
  - Added `ValidationRecord` struct to `internal/state/state.go` with fields: human_ratified, ratified_by, ratified_at, positive_scenarios, negative_scenarios, benefit_hypothesis, release_benefit_link.
  - Added `Validation` field to `Status` struct.
  - Created `internal/reqvalidate/` package with `Run()`, `validateSlice()`, `Print()`, `PrintCompact()`.
  - Validation checks: human_ratified=true, ≥1 positive scenario, ≥1 negative scenario, non-empty benefit hypothesis.
  - No model dispatch — deterministic gate reading status.json directly.
  - Created `cmd/sworn/reqvalidate.go` — `sworn reqvalidate <release>` command.
  - Added `reqvalidate` case to `cmd/sworn/main.go` switch and usage text.
  - Updated `internal/prompt/planner.md` Phase 4: added step 7 for drafting scenarios + benefit hypothesis with human ratification requirement.
  - Updated `internal/adopt/baton/rules/08-requirements-fidelity.md`: added "Validation — human-owned sense-check" section with validation record table and enforcement description.
  - Written 15 unit tests covering all acceptance checks (missing record, model-only, positive-without-negative, negative-without-positive, missing benefit hypothesis, complete passes).
  - Smoke test confirmed: `sworn reqvalidate 2026-06-16-fidelity-layer` exits 1 with all 16 slices named in violations (fail-closed, no validation records populated yet).

## Verifier verdicts received

### 2026-06-18 — verifier verdict: FAIL

**Verdict**: FAIL

**Violations:**

1. Gate 3 — Rule 1 integration test missing for CLI entry point `cmdReqvalidate`.
   The spec requires "Integration: `sworn reqvalidate` exercised on a fixture release (Rule 1)."
   No `cmd/sworn/reqvalidate_test.go` exists to exercise the CLI integration point. The only tests
   are in `internal/reqvalidate/reqvalidate_test.go` (package reqvalidate), which call
   `reqvalidate.Run()` and `reqvalidate.validateSlice()` directly — leaf-level unit tests. The
   comparable S04 slice has `cmd/sworn/reqverify_test.go` that calls `cmdReqverify()` (in
   package main), which is the expected integration pattern. Rule 1 is explicit: "Leaf-level unit
   tests are fine in addition. They cannot be the sole proof of life."

**Required to address:**

Add `cmd/sworn/reqvalidate_test.go` in `package main` that calls `cmdReqvalidate()` with fixture
data. Minimum tests (mirroring S04's pattern in `cmd/sworn/reqverify_test.go`):
- `TestReqvalidateCmd_MissingReleaseArg` — no arg → exit 64
- `TestReqvalidateCmd_NonexistentRelease` — nonexistent release → exit 2
- `TestReqvalidateCmd_WithFixtureRelease` — temp dir with fixture slices (one passing, one failing),
  calls `cmdReqvalidate([]string{"test-release"})`, verifies exit 1 and named violation output

### 2026-06-18 — verifier verdict: FAIL (round 2)

**Verdict**: FAIL

**Violations:**

1. Gate 2 — proof.md "Files changed" section is stale and "Divergence from plan" omits S04 files in the diff range.
   Running `git diff --name-only 40b2af4b0077d03b041cd7ac8ae3324caaa29a15..HEAD` in a fresh
   context returns additional files not listed in proof.md and not explained in "Divergence from
   plan": `cmd/sworn/reqverify.go`, `cmd/sworn/reqverify_test.go`,
   `internal/reqverify/reqverify_test.go`, `.gitignore`. These are S04 re-implementation files —
   the start_commit (`40b2af4`) pre-dates S04's multiple FAIL/re-implementation cycles, which ran
   concurrently with S05 on this track. proof.md "Divergence from plan" says "None" and the
   "Files changed" section omits these files entirely.

**Required to address:**

1. Update proof.md "Files changed" to accurately reflect the full output of `git diff --name-only
   40b2af4b0077d03b041cd7ac8ae3324caaa29a15..HEAD` (all files in range, including S04 files).
2. Add a "Divergence from plan" entry explaining that `cmd/sworn/reqverify.go`,
   `cmd/sworn/reqverify_test.go`, `internal/reqverify/reqverify_test.go`, and `.gitignore` appear
   in the diff range because start_commit (`40b2af4`) pre-dates S04's re-implementation cycles
   (which ran concurrently with S05 on this track); these files are S04 scope (a distinct
   verified slice), not S05 scope.
### 2026-06-18 06:22 — re-implementation (address round-2 violations)

- **State**: `failed_verification → implemented`
- **Notes**:
  - Updated proof.md "Files changed" section to reflect the full `git diff --name-only 40b2af4..HEAD` output, including S04 re-implementation files, S05 self-tracking docs, and `.gitignore`.
  - Added "Divergence from plan" entry explaining S04 files in diff range (concurrent track slice re-implementation cycles pre-dating start_commit) and S05 self-tracking docs as expected side-effects.
  - All tests pass: `go test ./cmd/sworn/ -run TestReqvalidateCmd` (3/3 PASS), `go test ./internal/reqvalidate/...` (15/15 PASS), `go vet ./...` (clean).
  - Clearing `verification.result` to `pending` for upcoming fresh-context verification.
