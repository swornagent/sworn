# Release Board: `2026-06-19-safe-parallelism`

> Frontmatter is the machine-readable registry; the tables below mirror it.
> **Prerequisite**: `2026-06-16-fidelity-layer` must be fully merged before R3 implementation begins.

## Release summary

- **Goal**: concurrent multi-track delivery with fail-closed verify gate provably intact
  under concurrency; `sworn` TUI cockpit with blocked-slice TL;DR and interactive settings;
  `sworn login` credits on-ramp; webhook paging; `sworn mcp` as a universal AI planning +
  operations interface; multi-provider model support (Anthropic, Google/Vertex, Bedrock,
  Azure, OCI, Ollama native, plus OAI-compat presets for Groq, Mistral, DeepSeek,
  OpenRouter); per-role model config in config.json.
- **Target version / integration branch**: `release/v0.1.0`
- **Prerequisite release**: `2026-06-16-fidelity-layer` — fully merged before implementation
- **Started**: 2026-06-19
- **Target ship**: uncommitted
- **Intake**: `intake.md`
- **Stakeholder**: Brad (maintainer)
- **Tracking issue**: [#5](https://github.com/swornagent/sworn/issues/5)

## Tracks

> T1 goes first. T2, T3, T4 run in parallel after T1. T5 and T7 start after T3 merges
> (T5 also needs T1; T7 also needs T4). T6 starts after T2 + T5 merge.

| Track | Slices (in order) | Depends on | Branch | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `T1-concurrency-core` | S01 → S02a → S02b → S03 | — | `track/.../T1-concurrency-core` | merged |
| `T2-monitoring` | S04a → S04b → S04c → S05 | T1 | `track/.../T2-monitoring` | planned |
| `T3-commercial` | S06a → S06b → S07 → S09 → S18 → S19 → S21 | T1 | `track/.../T3-commercial` | planned |
| `T4-mcp` | S08a → S08b → S08c → S22 | T1 | `track/.../T4-mcp` | in_progress |
| `T5-providers` | S10 → S11 → S12 → S13 → S14 → S15 → S16 | T1 + T3 | `track/.../T5-providers` | planned |
| `T6-provider-ux` | S17 | T2 + T5 | `track/.../T6-provider-ux` | planned |
| `T7-mcp-extensions` | S20 | T3 + T4 | `track/.../T7-mcp-extensions` | planned |
| `T8-memory` | S23 → S24 → S25 | T1 | `track/.../T8-memory` | planned |
| `T9-telemetry` | S26 | T1 | `track/.../T9-telemetry` | planned |

### Execution order

```
Phase 1:  T1 (sequential)
Phase 2:  T2, T3, T4, T8, T9 (parallel after T1)
Phase 3:  T5 (after T1 + T3)
          T7 (after T3 + T4; may run in parallel with T5)
Phase 4:  T6 (after T2 + T5)
```

### Touchpoint matrix

> No row may carry `✓` in more than one column in the same parallel phase.
> `cmd/sworn/main.go` is a **documented shared file** (additive dispatch only).
> `(dep)` notation means the track writes this file only after the named dependency merges
> — the dep-edge serialises writes so they are not truly concurrent.

**T3 `depends_on T1` notes:**
- `internal/run/run.go`: S07 adds notification calls; serialised by dep edge
- `internal/model/client.go`: S06b adds proxy routing; serialised by dep
- `internal/scheduler/worker.go`: S07 adds notify call; S02b creates it; serialised by dep
- `cmd/sworn/init.go`: S09 extends model prompts; S18 adds catalog setup prompt; serialised by T1 dep
- `docs/templates/considerations.md`: S18 adds shipped template; new touchpoint, T3 owns it
- `internal/prompt/planner.md`: S18 adds Phase 2b (DRY gate + design consultation + arch conformance); T3 owns it
- `internal/prompt/implementer.md`: S19 adds deviation check step; T3 owns it
- `internal/prompt/verifier.md`: S19 adds catalog conformance check (undocumented deviation = FAIL); T3 owns it
- `docs/templates/decisions.md`: S18 adds decision registry template; T3 owns it
- `cmd/sworn/induction.go`: S19 adds one-time induction command; T3 owns it
- `internal/mcp/catalog.go`, `catalog_test.go`: S20 in T7; new files in T4's directory but T7 depends on T4 (already merged) — no conflict

**T7 `depends_on T3+T4` notes:**
- `internal/mcp/catalog.go` calls functions from packages T3 built (internal/config/,
  docs/considerations.md + docs/decisions.md paths); T7 starts after T3 merges — safe
- `plan_release` in S20 calls T4's internal `createRelease` function from S08c;
  T7 starts after T4 merges — safe
- `internal/config/config.go`: S09 adds implementer fields; T3 owns this file

**T5 `depends_on T1+T3` notes:**
- `cmd/sworn/run.go`: S10 switches to factory; T1 creates exported RunSlice, T3 adds notify
  calls; T5 starts after both merge — no conflict
- `go.mod`, `go.sum`: T1 adds modernc.org/sqlite; T5 adds provider SDKs after T1 merges
- T5 only touches `internal/model/` (new files), go.mod, cmd/sworn/run.go, CLAUDE.md,
  docs/adr/0004-* — no conflict with T2 or T4

**T6 `depends_on T2+T5` notes:**
- `internal/tui/tui.go`: T2 creates it; T6 adds `s` key binding after T2 merges
- `cmd/sworn/top.go`: T2 owns it; T6 modifies it after T2 merges
- `internal/config/config.go`: T3 owns it; T6 adds Save() after T3 merges (via T5 dep chain)

## Recent activity

### 2026-06-21 — S08a verifier verdict: PASS (round 1)

- **Verifier**: fresh-context session, artefact-only inputs (Rule 7 compliant)
- **Slice**: S08a-mcp-transport → state: **verified** (SHA fb35263)
- **All six gates passed.** `sworn mcp` subcommand wired in `cmd/sworn/main.go`; MCP JSON-RPC 2.0 server in `internal/mcp/server.go`; 11/11 tests pass via `io.Pipe` roundtrips exercising the `Run` loop; CLI smoke-step artefact documented; no silent deferrals; all 6 ACs delivered.
- **Next**: `/implement-slice S08b-mcp-ops-tools 2026-06-19-safe-parallelism` in a fresh session.

### 2026-06-21 — track `T1-concurrency-core` merged to release-wt (commit 581b6a9)

- **Actor**: track integrator (/merge-track)
- **Note**: 4 verified slices merged: S01-process-ownership, S02a-run-refactor, S02b-concurrent-scheduler, S03-verify-under-concurrency. Track state → merged.

### 2026-06-21 — S03 verifier verdict: PASS (round 1)

- **Verifier**: fresh-context session, artefact-only inputs (Rule 7 compliant)
- **Slice**: S03-verify-under-concurrency → state: **verified** (SHA ed4919d)
- **All six gates passed.** `verify.Run()` wired in `internal/run/slice.go:183`; both concurrent tests pass under `-race`; `go test -race -count=10` zero races; no silent deferrals; all 6 ACs delivered with evidence.
- **T1-concurrency-core is complete.** All slices (S01, S02a, S02b, S03) are now verified. T1 state → ready_to_merge.
- **Next**: `/merge-track T1-concurrency-core` in a fresh session, then `/merge-release 2026-06-19-safe-parallelism` once every track is merged.

### 2026-06-21 — S02b verifier verdict: PASS (round 5)

- **Verifier**: fresh-context session, artefact-only inputs
- **Slice**: S02b-concurrent-scheduler → state: **verified** (SHA ac62587)
- **All six gates passed.** `sworn run --parallel` wired end-to-end; `TestCmdRun_Parallel` proves full CLI path; concurrency/failure-cascade/dependency-ordering proven by test suite; no silent deferrals; all delivered items verified.
- **Next**: `/implement-slice S03-verify-under-concurrency 2026-06-19-safe-parallelism` in a fresh session.

### 2026-06-21 — S02b verifier verdict: FAIL (round 4, 2 violations)

- **Actor**: verifier (fresh context, Rule 7 compliant)
- **Slice**: S02b-concurrent-scheduler → state: failed_verification
- **Violation 1 (Gate 3 + AC-2)**: Context-chain bug in `RunParallel` (`parallel.go:110`): `phaseCtx, phaseCancel = context.WithCancel(phaseCtx)` derives each phase's context from the previous (cancelled) phase context. After phase 0 completes and `phaseCancel()` is called, phase 1's context is immediately cancelled. All dependent tracks (phase 1+) are skipped with "depends_on failed (phase barrier)" even when their dependencies PASS. Verified: T1 passes → T2 (depends_on T1) is SKIPPED. Fix: `context.WithCancel(ctx)` at `parallel.go:110`.
- **Violation 2 (Gate 3)**: No test covers the AC-2 success path. All existing tests use single-phase plans (no deps exercised). The bug persisted through 4 rounds because no test placed a dependent track in phase 1 with a passing dependency.
- **Next**: `/implement-slice S02b-concurrent-scheduler 2026-06-19-safe-parallelism` in a fresh session. Fix: (1) change `context.WithCancel(phaseCtx)` → `context.WithCancel(ctx)` at `parallel.go:110`; (2) add `TestRunParallel_DependentTrackRunsAfterSuccess` in `parallel_test.go`.

### 2026-06-21 — S02b verifier verdict: FAIL (round 3, 1 violation)

- **Actor**: verifier (fresh context, Rule 7 compliant)
- **Slice**: S02b-concurrent-scheduler → state: failed_verification
- **Violation 1 (Gate 4)**: Spec prescribes "smoke step — `sworn run --parallel --release <fixture>`" as the reachability artefact. Proof substitutes unit test output from `TestRunParallel_TimingConcurrency` (which calls `RunParallel()` directly). The `cmdRun()` entry point in `cmd/sworn/run.go:63-91` (DB open, RunSliceFn closure, RunParallel dispatch) is exercised by no test and no documented binary invocation.
- **All other gates (1, 2, 3, 5, 6) passed.** Tests all pass with `-race` (fresh run verified). Implementation is functionally correct.
- **Next**: `/implement-slice S02b-concurrent-scheduler 2026-06-19-safe-parallelism` in a fresh session. Fix: either run the binary against a fixture and paste actual stderr output into proof.md, OR add `TestCmdRun_Parallel` in `cmd/sworn/run_test.go` invoking `cmdRun()` with `--parallel`.

### 2026-07-01 — S02b verifier verdict: FAIL (round 2, 1 violation)

- **Actor**: verifier (fresh context, Rule 7 compliant)
- **Slice**: S02b-concurrent-scheduler → state: failed_verification
- **Violation 1 (Gate 2)**: `start_commit` in status.json is `d9ff1b1` (re-implementation start), but planned touchpoints (scheduler.go, worker.go, parallel.go, track.go, run.go, scheduler_test.go) were committed in round-1 commit `5bb3666` which predates `d9ff1b1`. `git diff --name-only d9ff1b1` shows only docs/prompt/binary files, not the planned implementation files. proof.md "Files changed" falsely claims these files "were committed in start_commit `d9ff1b1`" — only parallel_test.go and worker_test.go were in that commit.
- **Note**: All tests pass with -race. Gate 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 all pass. The implementation is functionally correct; only the proof.md accuracy and start_commit value are at issue.
- **Next**: `/implement-slice S02b-concurrent-scheduler 2026-06-19-safe-parallelism` in a fresh session to fix start_commit (→ 821edf2) and update proof.md "Files changed."

### 2026-06-27 — S02b verifier verdict: FAIL (6 violations)

- **Actor**: verifier (fresh context, Rule 7 compliant)
- **Slice**: S02b-concurrent-scheduler → state: failed_verification
- **Violation 1 (Gate 3)**: `TestWorkerMaterialisesWorktree` absent; worktree materialisation branch untested.
- **Violation 2 (Gate 3)**: `TestWorkerCallsRunSlice` absent; single-slice count assert only.
- **Violation 3 (Gate 3)**: AC-3 failure cascade has no functional test — both fake-fail helpers return nil and are never called.
- **Violation 4 (Gate 3)**: "fake workers with controllable timing channels" not implemented; AC-1 concurrency assertion has zero coverage.
- **Violation 5 (Gate 2)**: `parallel_test.go` and `sworn` binary in committed diff but absent from proof.md and unexplained in Divergence from plan.
- **Violation 6 (Gate 4)**: Reachability artefact shows commented expected output with inconsistent fixture (2 tracks vs. real 9-track board); smoke step not demonstrably executed.
- **Next**: `/implement-slice S02b-concurrent-scheduler 2026-06-19-safe-parallelism` in a fresh session to address all 6 violations.

### 2026-06-20 — board reconciliation: T1 slice states corrected from oracle

- **Actor**: planner (Claude)
- **Note**: index.md body tables were stale vs. branch reality. Corrected:
  S01 `implemented` → `verified` (verifier PASS on T1 branch); S02a `planned` →
  `verified` (verifier PASS on T1 branch); S02b `planned` → `design_review`
  (implementer escalated: design.md committed, awaiting Captain ack).
  T1 Tracks table row corrected `planned` → `in_progress`. Aggregate state updated:
  Planned 31 → 29; Implemented 1 → 0; Verified 0 → 2; Design review: 1 added.
  No spec changes. Replan trigger: `/replan-release` invoked while S02b was in
  `design_review` state; correct next step is `/design-review S02b-concurrent-scheduler`.

### 2026-06-20 — S02a verifier verdict: PASS

- **Actor**: verifier (fresh context, Rule 7 compliant)
- **Slice**: S02a-run-refactor → state: verified
- **All six gates passed.** `RunSlice()` exported and wired; 12/12 tests pass with `-race`; state transitions verified live; no deferrals; `Run()` regression suite clean.
- **Next**: `/implement-slice S02b-concurrent-scheduler 2026-06-19-safe-parallelism` in a fresh session.

### 2026-06-20 — S02a verifier verdict: FAIL

- **Actor**: verifier (fresh context)
- **Slice**: S02a-run-refactor → state: failed_verification
- **Violation 1**: `start_commit` is null in status.json — required field not set; diff range cannot be formally bounded. Fix: set `start_commit` to `0aaa4b1`.
- **Violation 2**: Gate 6 — test names `TestRunSlice_Pass` and `TestRunSlice_Fail` do not match spec AC names `TestRunSlice` and `TestRunSliceFail`; proof.md "Divergence from plan" incorrectly records "(none)". Fix: rename tests and update proof.md.
- **Note**: 11/11 tests pass with `-race`; functional implementation is sound. Both violations are process/naming compliance issues.
- **Next**: `/implement-slice S02a-run-refactor 2026-06-19-safe-parallelism` in a fresh session.

### 2026-06-20 — S01 verifier verdict: PASS

- **Actor**: verifier (fresh context, session 3)
- **Slice**: S01-process-ownership → state: verified
- **All six gates passed.** Entry point wired (`sworn run --task` → `run.Run()` → `supervisor.Reap()/Acquire()`); touchpoint divergences documented; all required tests pass with `-race`; proof.md documents exact crash-and-reap smoke commands; no silent deferrals in code; all delivered items verified against live repo.
- **Next**: `/implement-slice S02a-run-refactor 2026-06-19-safe-parallelism` in a fresh session.

### 2026-06-20 — S01 verifier verdict: FAIL (Gate 4 + Gate 6)

- **Actor**: verifier (fresh session)
- **Slice**: S01-process-ownership → state: failed_verification
- **Gate 4**: proof.md reachability artefact lacks required exact smoke-step commands (crash-and-reap cycle); spec requires them documented in proof.md.
- **Gate 6**: proof.md "Delivered" claims `cmd/sworn/run.go` was updated but it is not in the diff; actual supervisor integration is in `internal/run/run.go`. Replan explicitly required this correction before re-verification; it was not applied.
- **Next**: `/implement-slice S01-process-ownership 2026-06-19-safe-parallelism` to address both violations.

### 2026-06-20 — replan: T9-telemetry added (S26; anonymous usage telemetry)

- **Actor**: planner (Claude)
- **Note**: Added T9-telemetry (depends T1, parallel Phase 2). Single slice S26:
  anonymous command telemetry to api.sworn.sh/v1/events. Schema: cmd, sub,
  duration_ms, exit_code, sworn_version, os/arch, anonymous install_id (UUIDv4).
  No code/paths/content collected. Opt-out via SWORN_NO_TELEMETRY env var or
  ~/.config/sworn/.no-telemetry sentinel file. First-run disclosure on stderr.
  Client fails silently if api.sworn.sh is unreachable (ships ready; backend
  goes live separately). No new external deps (stdlib net/http only). cmd/sworn/
  main.go wrap is additive. Release now 32 slices across 9 tracks.

### 2026-06-20 — replan: T8-memory added (S23/S24/S25; cross-harness semantic memory search)

- **Actor**: planner (Claude)
- **Note**: Added T8-memory (depends T1, parallel with T2/T3/T4). Three sequential
  slices: S23-memory-config (config schema + harness path discovery + `sworn memory
  status`), S24-memory-engine (embedding adapter for voyage-code-3/oai-compat/ollama
  + SQLite vector index + `sworn memory build`), S25-memory-search (`sworn memory
  search` + captain-memory-search.py shim). No new external deps: embedding API
  calls use stdlib net/http; SQLite index reuses modernc.org/sqlite from T1.
  Phase 2 now: T2, T3, T4, T8 run in parallel after T1. Release now 31 slices
  across 8 tracks.

### 2026-06-26 — S01 verifier verdict: BLOCKED (spec defect) — Resolved by replan above

- **Actor**: verifier (fresh session)
- **Slice**: S01-process-ownership → state unchanged (implemented, verification.result = blocked)
- **Reason**: Spec names `sworn run --parallel` as S01's entry point (Gate 1). S02b's spec explicitly owns this flag. S01's correct entry point is `sworn run --task`, which the implementation correctly wires.

### 2026-06-20 — replan: S01 spec corrected; BLOCKED verdict cleared

- **Actor**: planner (Claude)
- **Note**: Verifier returned BLOCKED on S01. Primary defect: spec named `sworn run
  --parallel` as entry point (that flag is S02b scope); implementation correctly uses
  `sworn run --task`. Spec amended throughout. Gate 6 (subsumed): `proof.md` falsely
  attributes supervisor integration to `cmd/sworn/run.go`; actual file is
  `internal/run/run.go`. Proof correction deferred to implementer before next
  verification attempt. `verification.result` cleared to `pending`; state stays
  `implemented`. S01 row corrected from `planned` to `implemented` in board.

### 2026-06-20 — replan: canonical Baton + sworn doctor (S21 T3, S22 T4; S08c fixed)

- **Actor**: planner (human + Claude)
- **Note**: Identified seam between binary-embedded prompts, Baton on developer machines,
  and per-repo Baton copies. Resolution: binary IS canonical Baton. S21 embeds full
  Baton protocol at internal/prompt/baton/ (go:embed); rewrites sworn init to stop
  writing docs/baton/ and stop splicing AGENTS.md — minimal MCP-pointer AGENTS.md
  written instead; ADR-0005 documents the architecture; user prompt overrides deferred
  post-launch. S22 (T4) adds sworn doctor: embedded prompt integrity checks, legacy
  artifact detection (docs/baton/, old-style AGENTS.md splice) with --fix, optional
  ~/.claude/baton/ sync with --sync-baton. S08c spec fixed: sworn://prompts/* and
  new sworn://baton/* resources now explicitly read from internal/prompt/ embed, NOT
  from $HOME/.claude/baton/. 28 slices across 7 tracks.

### 2026-06-20 — replan: induction + MCP catalog tools (S19 T3, S20 T7-new; S18 revised)

- **Actor**: planner (human + Claude)
- **Note**: S18 revised (adds decision registry docs/decisions.md, full design consultation
  + architecture conformance pattern in planner Phase 2b, DRY gate). S19 added to T3:
  `sworn induction` one-time repo onboarding; implementer + verifier prompts gain
  deviation-surfacing steps (undocumented deviation = BLOCKED/FAIL). New T7-mcp-extensions
  track (depends T3+T4) with S20: 8 MCP tools for catalog/decision management + unified
  plan_release tool (replaces create_release from S08c; S08c now implements createRelease
  as an internal function called by S20's plan_release). 26 slices across 7 tracks.

### 2026-06-20 — replan: consideration catalog added (S18, T3 append)

- **Actor**: planner (human + Claude)
- **Note**: S18-consideration-catalog appended to T3-commercial. Typed dimension catalog
  (security/api/data/observability/ui/performance/compliance) at docs/considerations.md;
  planner prompt gains Phase 2b audit step; sworn init scaffolds starter from shipped
  template. RAG-backed NFR sources and guided elicitation wizard deferred post-R3 (Rule 2
  cards in spec). Release now has 24 slices across 6 tracks.

### 2026-06-20 — replan: provider support + TUI settings added (9 new slices, 2 new tracks)

- **Actor**: planner (human + Claude)
- **Note**: Added T5-providers (S10-S16: provider router, ADR 0004, native drivers for
  Anthropic/Google/Bedrock/Azure/OCI/Ollama, OAI-compat presets for Groq/Mistral/
  DeepSeek/OpenRouter) and T6-provider-ux (S17: TUI settings panel). S09-per-role-model-
  config appended to T3-commercial. Dep policy revised from "zero runtime deps" to
  "minimal, justified deps + ADR required" (ADR 0004, documented in S10). OpenCode
  provider coverage used as baseline for provider scope.
- **Replan trigger**: user requested multi-provider model driver support, per-role config,
  .env file loading, and TUI settings for provider/model configuration.

### 2026-06-20 — bootstrapped release-wt branch

- **Actor**: planner (Claude)
- **Note**: `release-wt/2026-06-19-safe-parallelism` branch and worktree created from
  `release/v0.1.0` HEAD (bab35d3). Initial planning was committed directly to the
  integration branch before implementation started; release-wt now diverges from that
  point. `release_worktree_path` updated in frontmatter.

### 2026-06-20 — re-decomposed from 8 to 14 slices

- **Actor**: planner (human + Claude)
- **Note**: 4 over-scoped slices split on review: S02→S02a+S02b, S04→S04a+S04b+S04c,
  S06→S06a+S06b, S08→S08a+S08b+S08c. Each split slice is now a genuine
  one-implementer-session + one-verifier-session unit.

### 2026-06-19 — release planned; specs written

- **Actor**: planner (human + Claude)
- **Note**: 14 slices, 4 tracks. T1 first; T2/T3/T4 parallel after T1.

## Cross-slice / cross-track notes

- **S01 is T1's keystone.** S02a, S02b, S03 all depend on the DB + supervisor API.
- **S02a before S02b.** The RunSlice() refactor must be verified before the scheduler
  is built on top of it.
- **S04a before S04b before S04c.** Each TUI slice extends the previous foundation.
- **S06a before S06b.** Proxy routing requires credentials from the auth flow.
- **S08a before S08b before S08c.** Transport must work before tools are registered.
- **S09 appended to T3 tail.** Per-role model config added after S07-paging. T3 worktree
  starts from release-wt after T1 merges, so S09 can safely touch config.go and run.go.
- **S10 before S11-S16.** The provider router and ProviderConfig struct must exist before
  any native driver can register itself. S10 is T5's keystone.
- **S10 adds stub `ErrDriverNotRegistered` for native prefixes.** S11-S16 each replace
  one stub with a real implementation.
- **S16 replaces the OAI-compat ollama preset.** After S16, `ollama/*` model IDs route
  to the native Ollama driver, not the OAI shim. Backward compatible: same prefix, better
  behaviour.
- **T5 `depends_on T1+T3`.** T5 needs T1 for the exported model interface (post-S02a
  refactor) and go.mod. T5 needs T3 for config.go (S09 adds implementer fields that S10
  reads). T5 starts after BOTH merge.
- **T6 `depends_on T2+T5`.** S17 extends T2's TUI files and T5's ProviderConfig struct.
  T6 starts after BOTH merge.
- **T3 serialised behind T1** via `depends_on`: S07 touches `run.go` and `worker.go`
  created by T1. The dep edge ensures T3's worktree starts from release-wt after T1's
  changes are merged — no touchpoint conflict.
- **`cmd/sworn/main.go`** is documented shared. Each track adds additive dispatch
  cases only. Each command implementation lives in its own `cmd/sworn/<cmd>.go` file.
  T5 and T6 do not need new top-level commands; they touch existing files only.
- **R2 S15 (`sworn top`) coordination**: S04a absorbs/extends `cmd/sworn/top.go`.
  R3 implementation gates on R2 being merged; no parallel-edit risk.
- **T8 `depends_on T1`**: S24 uses `modernc.org/sqlite` from go.mod (added by S01).
  T8 starts after T1 merges. `internal/memory/` is entirely new; no collision with
  any other track. `cmd/sworn/memory.go` is new; additive dispatch to `main.go` only.
- **T9 `depends_on T1`**: `internal/telemetry/` is entirely new. `cmd/sworn/main.go`
  touch is additive (wrap dispatch + disclosure call). No collision with any track.
  T9 can start immediately after T1 merges, parallel with T2/T3/T4/T8.
- **T9 → T3/S09 soft dependency**: T9 ships `internal/telemetry.ShowConsent()`; T3/S09
  adds the consent question to `sworn init` by importing it. T9 should merge before S09
  starts. If T9 is still in flight when S09 begins, the T3 implementer stubs the call
  and wires it in a follow-up commit once T9 lands (still within T3's worktree, no new
  touchpoint). This soft dep is not enforced via `depends_on` (that would delay T9 until
  T3 completes, which inverts the flow) — it is a best-effort merge ordering preference.
- **S26 `api.sworn.sh` backend**: endpoint may not be live at R3 ship time.
  `Fire()` silently drops on any network error — no user impact. Telemetry begins
  flowing once the SwornAgent backend endpoint is deployed.
- **S25 touches `~/.claude/bin/captain-memory-search.py`**: This is a baton install
  file, not in the repo. S25 spec documents the shim update as an out-of-tree
  deliverable; the implementer applies it to the local baton install and notes the
  path in `proof.md`.
